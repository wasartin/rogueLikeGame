Inside of the main method I create the WINDOW base, which is the screen the player will see. I initilize everything in the main, then
       I check for which key is being pressed by the player. If they decide to go up or down the stairs I use a goto statment to go back
       to dungeon creation and make a new level. Levels are not maintained. Then I check if they are requesting to see the monster screen
       (pressing m), I calculate and display the mosnter screen accordingly, only showing a total of ten monsters at a time. The player
       can scroll up or down. If the player pressed Q, then they will leave the game. Finally they go to a method called runGame(...).
      
This method calls for the method action(char action, int *addRow, int *addCol) which will help give the direction for the character.

There were not major changes to the game outside of adding ncurses. After enough turns certain monsters will stop moving, but that
      is unreleated to this assignment and something I am currently debugging.
