Inside of my main file (dungeonGame.cpp) I have parseFile(Dungeon *d) and printMonsterDescriptions(Dungeon *d), Then the program will exit. 
       In parseFile(...) I find the file, print what it is by the meta data (the first line). Then I go to parsing. I use an enumMap to 
       understand the first word of each line that decides what will happen. Then I parse accordingly. When a monster description is fully 
       loaded, I add it into a vector<monsterDescription> mD where I will iterate through later to print out the values.
