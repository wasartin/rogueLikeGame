8/24
	just going to write down all the requirements and see where that gets me.
	-have some method ideas like 'isLegalPlace(), void placeRoom().
	-Trying to start small, working on how to hold the rooms. I think I will have a struct for the point which has a x and a y,
	and a struct for room that would be the actual room, and they would hold point1 and point 2 which 
	contains the dagnals spots of a room.

	- 1.02 requires a dynamically allocated room array, not sure what that means yet.
	- 1.03 requires that rock cells have hardness, not sure how to do this yet.
8/26
	-No idea what the heck to do... just going to try and figure out the rooms. 
	-Dungeon was orignally just an array, but I am turning it into a struct.

8/27
	-Just removing enums for now, don't know what I am doing.
	-had a memeber of the struct Dungeon called numOfRooms, then i use that number in another member called
	room rooms[numOfRooms]. It isn't working, i think becasue it is never initilized, so I'll use one of my 
	const static int value MAX_NUMBER_OF_ROOMS to help initilize the array of rooms
	-changing the structure of struct, to use typedef. 
	-Just working on generating the rooms, and printing out the number of rooms.

	-Just got the number of rooms to print, so I am correctly accessing my struct, but every time I run it 
	the 'random number'is just the same number over and over again.
	Found this link, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rand-and-srand-in-ccpp/ that shows how to use srand and the
	time to make an actual random number
	-So rooms work, I think I will have a method called placeRooms(dungeon) which will pick random positions, 
	then will load that position into a method
	      called isLegalPlace(room, dungeon, row, col) that first checks if the placement is in the bounds of 
	      the board, then checks if the placement
	      will be on top of or adjacent to any other room. Going write everything out.
	      -just made a method called isInBounds() and isNotAdjaentToARoom() method to make isLegalPlace() a smaller method
	-Also, this class is getting to be too long. will need to figure out how to use more than one file.
8/28
	-Almost finished with placeRoom. 
	     Awesome news, rooms are being made and placed in dungeon... but they seem to be overlapping.
	     The number of rooms generated does not match the rooms shows, and some are right next to check 
	      other. So I am pretty sure they are overlapping. Will begin debugging now.
	     -RESOLVED- the issue was is void placeRoom() was calling boolean isLegalPlace(...) which called 
	        both boolean isInBounds(...) and boolean isNotAdjacentToARoom(...). I thouhgt i could just call
	        isInBounds(...) and if that returned FALSE, then the outter methodisLegalPlace(...) would return 
	        false too. but this is not the case. so i did this if(isInBounds(...) == FALSE) return FALSE;
	             this resolved the situation.
	    - Right now I have the immutable space as the border. IDK if there should be a border THEN an immutable 
	           space. I will ask.
	    - All of my rooms seem pretty large too.
	-Now time to connect all of the rooms. I have no idea how to do this.
	     -Teacher said to use Euclidean distance. (X0, Y0) and (X1, Y1). draw from Y0 to X1 then X0 to Y1. 
	     -abs[(x1 - x0)/(x1-xo)] to help increment
	     -for(pos = start; pos != end; pos += increment) drawCorridor;

8/29
	-changed the way my seed operates for my srand. The teacher recomended taking an argument for debugging,
	     and also printing out the one used.
	-Going to sort the array inside the Dungeon struct, so that connecting them will be easier. (I think)
	-Keep track of seed 1535594805, makes me thing about changing assortion of rooms. Should sort by 
	      point 2 to point one. or just by points one. like make a method compare points. if one is 
	      higher left than another, that one goes first. keep that idea in the TODO

	-Stuck in infinte loop inside of connectRooms. I have it trying to connect Room1.point2 with Room2.point1;
	     Going to put an attempt limit inside the while loop. To see where I am at.
	     -Really wanna select one room then select the 2nd room randomly and connect those. this sorted this is eh
		-Also, could pick which two points to connect to randomly too

	left off with seed 1535595011

8/30
	-I just finished it. My algorithm for connected rooms was:
	     1.) for each room
		a.) select curr room pt2 at current Coordinate and the next room's pt1 as destination Coordinate.
	        b.) While currCoord != destination
		     1- increment in the x or y direction.
		     2- draw if it is allowed.
	-Going to try the two bad seeds I encountered earlier, and if they work I am going to try to make
	     connectRooms(...) concise...
	     -Alright both bad seeds work just fine. 
	-Going to reconstructure the code. Right now main is called everything, like calling setDungeon(...)
	     generateRooms(...), then placeRooms(...), setSortedArray(...), then connectRooms(...) then print map.
	     I think it would be better to make a function called initilizeDungeon(...) that called all that stuff.
	     Then it might be esier to do the save/load functions later. As well as making the program easier to
	     understand.
	- It's looking better, but i would like to make the connectRoom method better. At least more random

8/31
	-I think that Corridors should probably have a struct. They would have both points just like rooms. Beyond that, 
	      I don't know what else. But i think making them a struct will help me with refactoring later.
	-Going to try to figure out how to dynamically allocate my room array
	-The room array is now dynamically allocated, and hardness is finished as well.



BAD SEEDS:
	1535595854 : segmentation fault (Fixed now)
	1535596201 : 9 rooms, a total mess, and only connected two rooms (Fixed now)

	
8/31
	-Need to be able to load (read) and save (write) the dungeon.
	     what happens when someone uses both switches?
9/2
	-Trying to figure out how to make a directory in C, in Linux
	-Working on just making a file, reading, and writing. chapter 7.5 of The C ANSI Book has something on
	files, as well as some of chapter 8. Going to read those.
9/4
	-Working on writing a binary file
9/5
	-Finished the method saveGame(...), but I don't have anyway to really test this so I will need to finish loadGame(...)
		After loadGame() is done, Then I can see if it works wit the files the teacher is providing, then I can
		see if saveGame() works.
9/7
	-Teacher covered some file i/o stuff on 9/6. He talked about how to read the save or load switches, so I will work on that
	     now. Since I can't test save and load yet, I will just have it print out what occurs. ex: "User selected Save" etc...
	    -Got save and load to be reached. Will not just try to finish my load() so I can work with the Teacher's test files
9/11
	-Working on debugging whatever is wrong with loading. had to google how to use gdb, Used this website
		https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/03/debug-c-program-using-gdb/
		-When I access the marker I get weird symbols each time, and the result is always different.
	-Also I want to remove my point2 in my room struct. Don't think I need it. Hopefully I will have time to do that.

9/12
	-Stuck on saving. I noticed that the saved file is one byte bigger than the file i want to save. 
	       so i am writing something wrong.
	       -RESOLVED. forgot about the null byte at the end of the RLG327-F2018
	-I am getting random corridors, going to go into gdb
	     -The bug was in my hardnessMap. I had a range of 0-254 instead of 1-254. SO I added one to the bottom 
	     range. Saving and loading totally works.
	-Just finished all of my deciding stuff for decinding what to do in the main. Followed the teacher's code
	     of case and switch with his aciton enums, but i couldn't figure out how to make my dungeon and save it.
	     in a concise way, so I just did if/else stuff.
	-Totally done. 
	-
9/16
	-Splitting the file into multiple files. It is getting to be too much to scroll through. Plus it would be better to have
	     a more modular design
	-Working on getting the Makefile correct. Looked at the teacher's it was a nightmare. No way I can dechipher that

9/17
	-Done breaking the files up/
	-Refactored how I connect rooms. Looks better now.
	-Removed some unneeded things. Like have the struct room have point two. Don't really need that. Removed it and renamed
	     point.one to just a coordinate with the name topLeftCoord.
	-Looking and reading his dijkstra's corridor to try to understand and apply that to my path finding.
9/18
	-Trying to make path finding now. need a normal one and one for monsters that can tunnel.
9/21
	-Trying to copy as much of his Corridor code, and understand it.
9/22
	-Printing is a mess. Most of the nonTunnelPath is just 0 with random numbers
	-Had wrong map being initilized. going to fix now.
9/23
	-No idea what is going on. just printing 5 everywhere. like every loc is at the value 5. I felt
	     like i was closer yesterday. Not even srue what i did. need to make small deliberate steps so
	     i don't do this again
	     -Ok, so I am comparing the next pos to just dist->cost. I should compare it to the non-altered pos.
		-ok i don't know what is going on.
		-I think this is my problem. I am comparing the wrong things. I misread part of his corridor
	          I have distance[d->pc.location.row][d->pc.location.col], for my first section. the arg
	          SHOULD be the the temp dist i made
	      -Ok, so dist_t *dist = heap_remove_min(&h) is my issue. nothing is being returned I think
	      -BACK to printing mostly 5's. have a few other things like 0 and 1 near the player.
	-I have numbers 1-6, but they only go out of bounds of the room. I THINK that the corridor code the teacher wrote
	     doesn't exactly translate to the nonTunnelMap version. So I will need to find a way to ensrue that
	     only things inside of the rooms and corridors go into the heap
	     -Ok, i add everything to the heap. i will check hardness then do it.
	     -I think that my issue is my comparator, b/c it's just a copy of the corridor one. I need it to be the 
	      two things I am actually comparing. idk how though. b/c they are inside of the dungeon.
	     -OK so my 5's are actually 255. because i set everyything just to max hardness. So will have to fix that
9/24
	-Went to help room, tried to refactor everything I made, still no results. This assignment has taken me forever
	    -My code is so similar to what the teacher provided for his corridor algorithm. I don't get what I am doing 
	    wrong.
9/25
	-Just finsihed the non Tunneling path. I had to make my method static. That was it. I don't know how that was 
	     causing negative numbers (maybe b/c my comparator method was static), but IDK and IDC. That part is finally
	     done. Time to start the tunneling monster path.
	-Totally forgot to add hardness into consideration for tunneling monsters. 
	-Not working. I am off by one in a couple of spots for the tunneling paths.
		-Got it. I had it where in the begingin of the while loop I assign u->cost = hardness[y][x] / 85 + 1, I
		changed it where i just have int addlCost = hardness[y][x] / 85 + 1, then when I compare i use 
		u->cost + addlCost, and this resolved the situation. I don't know why though. So i am worried that there
		may be something wrong in my code.
	-Totally working now
9/29
	-Starting now. Going to try to just move the character first.
9/30
	-Making all of the monsters
10/1
	-Made monsters incorectly, starting that over to better match the requirments of the assignment
	-Need to make player and monster same thing so that I can put them into the priority queue.
	-Weird seed 1538414325. reworte corridor as room cell. will need to fix.
10/2
	-Working on monsters again
	-Fixed the seed 1538414325, just followed the teacher's style of render Dungeon.
	-Added nummon switch. It works, right now I have it where no monsters spawns in the same room where the player
	    is, just doesn't seem fair.
10/3
	-Have a bug when I load, the first room always becomes just corridors
	-Only going to impelement two monsters,the ones required for the assignment
	-My --nummon switch won't accept an absurd number, will have to look into
10/8
	-Finally got all 16 monsters fully implemented, but I think I could still do some work on them.
	-Broke monsters into their own file
10/9
	-Fixed the bug I had where I couldn't update the distance maps
	-Starting the assignment now
10/10
	-Got ncurses to display my map
	-got the player to move
	-I want the game to declare win/lose
	-also starting the monster list. I think I will just make a new window over my current window. 
10/16
	-Found bug in moveMonster. Sometimes the column would be in teh 1000's. Turns out I was using an uninitilized variable.
	-Working on staris right now.
	     -Stairs are done
10/17
	-Scrolling is done.
	-added quit.
10/18
	-Working on monster movement. Weird that some jsut stop
10/19
	-Refactored moveMonster, no more idle monsters. 
	-Added method to sort monsters by their status. the dead go to the back of the list.
	-changed Character.representation to Character.type

10/20
	-Just finished porting everything to C++. 
	-Going to move I/O to its own file.

10/22 
	-Changing structs into classes.
	-Still workingo n moving I/O to its own file.
	    -Just finished
	-Working on Teleport right now, that seems really easily, especially since the Teacher already
	did the random teleport code for us.

10/23
	-Teleporting * will kill a monster when it is going over it., just have a case where * does not set taget to null
	-Teleporting * movement is weird (takes to clicks to move it)
	-Really need to change structs into classes
	-Teleport needs to go through rock
	-Ok, finally actually starting to turn structs into classes. Tearing Character.h into Character.h 
	     as a base class, and a npc.h and pc.h
	     -THis is going to break so much stuff, and take forever to get back together.
	     -Add semi colon and jsut fix my classeswtih the info from class
10/24
	-I am currently in the nightmare of changing Character into a parent class to npc and pc.
	-Added a move class. To better help with abstraction
	-I have so much to do now.

10/28
	-Fixed a bug where I would sometimes throw a seg fault when I teleport
	-Now I have a bug where the player can't kill any monster
	     -Fixed it. When I was killing monsters I was setting their status(whether they are alive or dead) to 1 instead of flase

-10/29
	-Switching Dungeon into a class. bUt it throws a seg fault when I change levels.
10/30
	-Lot of issues working with my code. going to switch to the teachers.
	-Making class for dice and monster descriptions
10/31
	-Ok nevermind, going back to my code. Taking to long to work with the teacher's code.
	-Removing monster description class, and just putting it and all the methods into my dungeonGame.cpp (main file)
	     I usually do this anyway, and after I submit it I put it into it's own file. Tried to skip this step this time
	     and it is not working out well.
	-Finally parsing files
	-Current issue is parsing description.
	     -Everything is printing fine, but description is a little off. I am following the 77 line limit, but that doesn't 
	     seem to be the right approach. Need to maybe see if a word will print there. Or save the \n somehow 
	     -Well nevermind, pretty easy fix. just added \n after every read line.
TODO:
	-Make my Makefile look more like the teachers.
	-Make a utils class for common methods I use throughout my code
	-Never stop refactoring
